# Level Ground

The task was to create the Level Ground landing page to the best of my ability. I managed to mirror this page with near perfect accuracy! Gave me a lot of insight on layouts and how to plan out my alignments, on paper, before I start to code. A fun and quick project!

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html & CSS

# What I Learned

Like I mentioned above, the biggest lesson was planning and organizing. I took on each section was a clear cut idea on how it would look in base, before styling the elements. This expedited this project two-fold! Definitely something I will be doing for all my projects, moving forward.
